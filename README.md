# Guess the Flag | Hacking with Swift

## A game to guess the flag of a country made entirely with SwiftUI

This project is an application created alongside the Hacking with Swift course by Paul Hudson where I learned some fundamental knowledge regarding SwiftUI includeing:

* Views
* Structs and Classes
* Protocols and Extensions
* Bindings

## I will post a GIF demonstrating the functionality of the project in the future!
